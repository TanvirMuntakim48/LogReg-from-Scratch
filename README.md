# Implementing Logistic Regression from Scratch 

In this notebook, I implement Logistic Regression from scratch and I further add a few extra things like:
* Mini-Batch Training
* L2 Regularization

The logistic regression model is trained on the Banana dataset obtained from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/l3llff/banana
